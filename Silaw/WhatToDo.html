        <p>Here are examples of what to do:</p>
        <br>
          <p>Switch to LED Bulbs:
          LED bulbs use up to 80% less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs and last up to 25 times longer.
          Action Tip: Replace old bulbs in your most frequently used rooms first, such as the kitchen, living room, and bathroom.</p>
          <br>
         <p> Use Natural Light:
          Maximize the use of natural daylight to reduce the need for artificial lighting during the day. Keep curtains open and arrange your workspace near windows.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Turn Off Unused Lights:
          Always turn off lights when you leave a room. You could also install motion sensors in spaces like hallways and garages to automate this process.</p>
        <form action="#" method="post">

          As the world grapples with the realities of climate change, the need for energy conservation has never been more urgent. Our reliance on electricity, largely generated from fossil fuels, contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation. However, individuals can make a considerable impact by adopting energy-saving practices in their daily lives. These actionable steps that everyone can take to conserve energy, reduce their carbon footprint, and contribute to a healthier planet.
